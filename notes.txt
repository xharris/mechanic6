===== Game Description =====

Welcome to Congo Inc!
For years we have been the #1 seller of automated household products. We're more than excited for you to join the team! 
Thank you for accepting the position ENTRY-LEVEL APPLIANCE ACTIVATOR. As discussed in the post-NDA meeting, our products are actually manually activated by our employees by monitoring the customer through CCTV and determining if they are requesting that an appliance be activated.â€‹

Your job is to use your Cam Manager 0.3 to monitor the family and their needs.  When a family member wants to use an appliance (  ), use the congo_appliance_rootkit.exe to activate the appliance.

Recent observations to remember:

activating a product too early will result in a complaint from the customer
waiting too long to activated a product will result in a complaint from the customer
Any complaints are taken seriously here at Congo Inc, so please be careful.



Sincerely,

Your boss
